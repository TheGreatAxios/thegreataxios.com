Hi!

My name is Sawyer and I am a contractor and work with a number of projects.
My biggest project is SKALE where I work as the VP of Developer Success.

In addition to that, I write a good amount and code a lot. If you are interested in sponsoring one of my blog posts, the development
of a proof of concept, paid research, or testing and feedback; you can email at
sawyer@dirtroad.dev or DM me on [Twitter](https://x.com/thegreataxios).
