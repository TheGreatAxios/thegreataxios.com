Hi!

My name is Sawyer. I’m a contractor working on a variety of projects, with my largest being SKALE, where I serve as VP of Developer Success.

In addition to that, I write extensively and code regularly.

If you’re interested in sponsoring a blog post, development of a proof of concept, commissioning paid research, or having me test and provide feedback, feel free to email me at sawyer@dirtroad.dev or DM me on Twitter at [thegreataxios](https://x.com/thegreataxios).

You can also [help support me with a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/thegreataxios).
