- [My Projects](/my-projects): A collection of open source projects spanning blockchain infrastructure, onchain payments, and developer tools.
- [Sponsor](/sponsor): Hi!
- [AI for Dummies (who don't use AI)](/blog/ai-for-dummies-who-dont-use-ai): This article explores three practical ways developers who don't use AI-first workflows can leverage artificial intelligence to enhance their productivity. From generating complex CURL requests through terminal AI tools, to implementing obscure native APIs, and creating comprehensive inline documentation for smart contracts, these targeted applications demonstrate how selective AI integration can streamline development tasks without requiring a complete overhaul of traditional coding approaches.
- [Authoritative Actions](/blog/authoritative-actions): This article explores how authoritative servers can enhance Web3 applications by preventing bot abuse and managing game state while preserving decentralization benefits through strategic implementation. By leveraging OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for role-based permissions, developers can create secure authority layers that dynamically grant temporary access rights for on-chain actions, with this approach proving most effective on zero-gas-fee blockchains like SKALE that offer instant finality without the operational challenges posed by variable transaction costs and slow confirmation times.
- [Enhancing Unity Game Development](/blog/enhancing-unity-game-development): This comprehensive overview showcases Eidolon's modular Unity SDK ecosystem designed to accelerate game development through specialized, lightweight packages that handle everything from OS device data access and physics calculations to Web3 blockchain integration and networking. Each SDK integrates seamlessly with zero conflicts, providing developers with powerful tools for randomization, timer management, controller input handling, and WalletConnect support while enabling faster development cycles for both traditional Web2 and emerging Web3 gaming experiences.
- [Proof-of-Encryption in the Cloud](/blog/proof-of-encryption-in-the-cloud): This article explores the revolutionary BITE Protocol that implements Proof of Encryption using threshold cryptography and multi-party signatures to enable fully encrypted blockchain transactions resistant to MEV attacks. Unlike traditional trusted execution environments, BITE embeds encryption directly into consensus through provable mathematics, requiring zero Solidity changes while offering cloud API accessibility for encrypted transactions across any programming language, with FAIR L1 blockchain pioneering the implementation before broader SKALE Chain adoption.
- [Scaling Authority on the EVM](/blog/scaling-authority-on-the-evm): This technical guide addresses the critical scaling challenges faced by authoritative servers in blockchain applications due to the EVM's sequential nonce requirement. By implementing a Signing Pool architecture using HD wallet-derived child signers, developers can overcome nonce collision issues and scale from handling just a few concurrent requests to hundreds per second, complete with automatic gas balance management and dynamic signer selection for high-throughput applications on zero-gas-fee networks like SKALE.
- [SKALE Governance Update - July 7, 2025](/blog/skale-governance-update-july-7-2025): This governance update examines SKALE Network's remarkable achievement of surpassing 1 billion cumulative transactions while maintaining zero gas fees and instant finality. The analysis covers the SKALE DAO's hybrid governance model combining onchain economic voting with offchain technical consensus, and explores how the upcoming FAIR L1 blockchain addresses critical ecosystem challenges by enabling permissionless DeFi deployment and reducing operational costs through a synergistic gas-fee architecture that captures value within the SKALE ecosystem.
- [SKALE's Secret Sauce for Game Developers](/blog/supercharge-your-game): This comprehensive guide explores how SKALE Network revolutionizes game development by providing blockchain infrastructure that replaces traditional servers, databases, and storage systems with zero-gas, high-performance alternatives. Supporting 500-13,000 transactions per second with instant finality and native random number generation, SKALE enables developers to build asset-based games, real-time multiplayer experiences, leaderboards, and autonomous worlds while eliminating the cost barriers that make blockchain impractical for gaming on other networks.
- [The Power of Random](/blog/the-power-of-random): This article explores SKALE Network's native random number generation system that uses threshold signatures from consensus nodes to create provably random numbers at zero gas cost. Unlike external oracles like Chainlink VRF, SKALE's RNG is free, synchronous, and built directly into the blockchain, enabling developers to generate unique NFT attributes and implement innovative game mechanics like Shape Storm's single-ownership roguelike where players can only hold one randomly-generated shape at a time.
- [The Rise of the Machine Economy](/blog/the-rise-of-the-machine-economy): This article examines how blockchain infrastructure, particularly SKALE Network's zero-gas, high-performance platform, will enable the emergence of a machine-driven economy powered by autonomous AI agents. By combining technologies like x402 for programmable payments, small language models for efficient AI processing, and decentralized identifiers for verifiable interactions, we can create seamless workflows where machines transact, collaborate, and execute economic activities without human intervention.
- [The Role of Pay-Per-Tool in an Agentic World](/blog/the-role-of-pay-per-tool-in-an-agentic-world): The role of agents and AI tooling is expanding very quickly. With
new releases, tools, models, and innovations coming out every day, it's important to understand the role of tools in agentic systems and why the consumption model may be in need of an economic change. This blog introduces the concept of a tool, walks through an example of a tool, and explores why pay-per-tool is the next logical step.
- [x402 via EIP-3009 Forwarding](/blog/x402-via-eip3009-forwarding): x402 is Coinbase's open protocol for internet-native payments that enables seamless blockchain transactions using ERC-3009 USDC. This article explores how to extend x402 to any blockchain through EIP-3009 forwarding contracts, with a focus on SKALE Network's zero-gas infrastructure that enables instant, cost-free transactions across any token on EVM-compatible chains.
