`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:[e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"Broader Roadmap"}),": Conversely, product roadmap decisions are made in the same manner Ethereum and Solana make decisions—not by onchain voting. In the case of FAIR, many key stakeholders, including validators, developers, and stakers, brought forward feedback to core contributors that SKALE needed to capture more economic value. A consistent idea brought forward was launching a SKALE ecosystem Layer 1 chain. This was publicly discussed on the forum last November: ",e.jsx(n.a,{href:"https://forum.skale.network/t/ideas-from-the-community-the-evolution-of-skale/533",children:"https://forum.skale.network/t/ideas-from-the-community-the-evolution-of-skale/533"}),"."]}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"Based on the positive feedback, the core contributors had many discussions with dApp devs, validators, stakers, infrastructure partners, and more. The result of these discussions was that the roadmap should include a Layer 1 chain—but it would need to be a true L1 chain in order to give the ecosystem a real opportunity to capture TVL. This meant that the L1 would need its own native token and could not use the bridged SKL token as its genesis token. This is because the highest point of security of the L1 would be the bridge and not the blockchain—if you hacked the bridge, then the entire chain would be compromised."}),`
`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"A new idea was then brought forward to make the new L1 a dual-token network. This would increase the utility of the SKL token through burning functions in the L1 while enabling the L1 to truly be an L1 that is secured by a native token. This premise was then discussed by numerous stakeholders and contributors, more feedback was integrated, and it was then added to the roadmap and announced in June. It was also announced with the caveat that any changes needing to be made to the SKALE Network smart contracts and core economic functions would first need to be ratified by an onchain vote before being finalized."}),`

`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:[e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"Permissionless SKALE Performant Technology"}),": SKALE is incredibly performant and highly stable. Most of the developers I’ve worked with, once they start using SKALE, don’t want to leave. However, developers have been asking to do things like token launchpads, onchain messaging, permissionless DeFi and token creation—things that don’t align well with the containerized design of SKALE Chains, which are generally not designed to support the level of state that permissionless chains do."]}),`
`,e.jsxs(n.p,{children:[e.jsx(n.strong,{children:"Enhanced DeFi with Gas Fees"}),": While much of blockchain—especially on the EVM—can be done without a native gas token, as proven by the SKALE Network, many DeFi protocols and key infrastructure components build on the native gas token directly, or at least by default support using it and wrapping automatically. I proposed in the forum a gas fee SKALE Chain and it was met with pretty open feedback. I think FAIR—which combines both gas fees and the permissionless blockchain layer—makes a ton of sense toward solving this proposal."]}),`

`,e.jsx(n.p,{children:"However, two areas that SKALE currently struggles with are operational costs and value capture. With SKALE Manager running on Ethereum and base liquidity being sourced from Ethereum as well, key network operation costs for users can often be $5–$15 in ETH when gas prices are low—and easily stretch into the dozens or hundreds of dollars when gas spikes during congestion. Compute-intensive operations like creating SKALE Chains, which cost over 0.5 ETH (over $1,350 at time of writing), are not feasible for more cost-effective SKALE Chains. Additionally, all gas fees spent on operations are lost to the Ethereum ecosystem and not captured by the SKALE ecosystem."}),`
