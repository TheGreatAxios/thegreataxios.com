# Not Everything Needs to be Agentic

This article discusses when agentic systems are appropriate and when they represent overkill. While agentic AI offers powerful capabilities, not every problem requires autonomous decision-making. Understanding when to use agentic systems versus simpler, more deterministic approaches is essential for building efficient and cost-effective applications.

## When Agentic Systems Make Sense

I've built agentic systems, and I've built simple automation. Here's when I think agents actually make sense:

- **Long-running tasks with multiple decision points** work well with agents
- **Complex goal pursuit that requires adaptation** is a good fit
- **Situations where the solution path isn't clear upfront** benefit from agentic approaches
- **Tasks that benefit from autonomous operation** are where agents shine

Real examples I've seen:

- Research tasks: "Find information about X, verify it, synthesize it, present findings"
- Multi-step workflows: "Plan a trip, book flights, reserve hotels, create itinerary"
- Problem-solving: "Debug this error, try different approaches, find the solution"
- Creative tasks: "Design a logo, iterate based on feedback, refine until approved"

I think the key indicators are: does the task require multiple decisions? Is the solution path uncertain? Would autonomous operation add value? Is the complexity worth the overhead?

I built an agentic system for research and synthesis. It was perfect for that use case—complex, multi-step, required adaptation. But I also built a simple script to format API responses. That didn't need to be agentic, and making it agentic would have been overkill.

The economic case matters too. Agentic systems cost more: more API calls, more compute, more complexity. But for the right use cases, the value justifies the cost. I think the key is identifying when the value is there. Don't use agents just because you can.

## When Simpler Solutions Are Better

I see this all the time: developers reaching for agentic solutions when a simple script would work better. Not every problem needs AI. Not every AI problem needs agents. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best solution.

Simple wins for:

- **Deterministic tasks**: "Format this data" doesn't need an agent
- **Single-step operations**: "Call this API" is just a function call
- **Well-defined workflows**: "If X, do Y" is better as code
- **High-frequency operations**: agents add latency and cost

Let me be honest: agents are expensive. Every decision point costs money. Simple automation might cost $0.001 per execution. An agentic system might cost $0.10+ per execution (often much more). For high-frequency tasks, this adds up fast. I think we should use agents where the value justifies the cost.

Simple scripts are predictable. Agents can be unpredictable. For critical operations, predictability matters. I'd rather have a simple script that always works than an agent that sometimes does the wrong thing.

Simple code is easy to debug. Agentic systems are hard to debug. When something breaks, you need to understand why. Simpler systems are easier to maintain.

I saw someone build an agent to format JSON responses. That's a one-liner in Python. Why? Data transformation should use scripts, not agents. API orchestration should use workflow tools, not agents. Simple decision trees should use if/else, not LLMs. I think it's about using the right tool for the right job.

Even with [x402](https://x402.org) making payments cheap, you don't need an agent for every API call. Some APIs are better called directly. Some workflows are better as simple scripts. Agents shine when you need decision-making, not just execution. Don't over-engineer the payment layer either.

## The Cost of Over-Engineering

Everyone focuses on API costs, but I think that's just the tip of the iceberg:

- **Development time**: agents take longer to build
- **Debugging time**: agents are harder to debug
- **Maintenance burden**: agents need ongoing tuning
- **Opportunity cost**: time spent on agents could be spent elsewhere

Simple solution: 100 lines of code, works reliably. Agentic solution: 1000+ lines, needs constant monitoring. The complexity compounds. More moving parts equal more things that can break. I've seen projects fail because they over-engineered with agents when simple automation would have worked.

Agents add latency: every decision takes time. Simple scripts are fast: direct execution. For real-time systems, latency matters. A simple script can respond in milliseconds. An agent takes seconds. Sometimes that matters.

Users don't care if it's agentic. They care if it works. Over-engineering can hurt UX. Simpler solutions are often faster and more reliable. I think we should focus on outcomes, not technology.

Simple code: any developer can understand and modify. Agentic systems: require specialized knowledge. Team velocity matters. I'd rather have a team that can ship simple solutions fast than a team that's stuck debugging complex agents.

At the end of the day, you need to ship and make money. Over-engineering delays shipping. Simple solutions get to market faster. I think time to market matters more than technical sophistication.

## Finding the Right Balance

Here's how I decide: does this need to make decisions, or just execute? Decision-making equals consider agents. Simple execution equals use scripts/workflows. The line isn't always clear, but I think this helps.

Always start with the simplest solution that works. Add complexity only when needed. You can always add agents later. You can't easily remove complexity once it's there.

Simple script → workflow automation → agentic system. Each step adds capability and complexity. Only move to the next step when you need it. I've built systems that started simple and evolved to agents. I think that's the right way to do it.

Most real systems are hybrid: some parts agentic, some parts simple. Use agents for decision-making. Use scripts for execution. Best of both worlds. I think this is often the optimal solution.

When building [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), I use agents for tool selection and parameter generation, but simple functions for the actual tool execution. Agents decide what to do. Simple code does it. This is the right balance.

With x402, I use agents to decide when to pay and how much, but simple payment logic to execute the transaction. Economic decision-making equals agentic. Payment execution equals simple. Again, the right balance.

The key is knowing when simple isn't enough. Signs you need agents:

- Simple solutions keep breaking
- You need adaptation to changing conditions
- The problem space is too complex for rules
- Autonomous operation would add real value

Be pragmatic, not dogmatic. Don't avoid agents because they're complex. Don't use agents because they're cool. Use the right tool for the job. I think this is engineering, not ideology.

## Conclusion

Not everything needs to be agentic. Most things don't. Agents are powerful, but they're not always the right tool. Simple solutions are often better. I think we should know when to use what.

Start simple, add complexity when needed. Use agents for decision-making, scripts for execution. Consider cost, reliability, and maintainability. Focus on outcomes, not technology.

As agents get cheaper and more reliable, the balance will shift. But I think the principles will remain: right tool for the right job. Don't over-engineer.

I've seen too many projects fail because they tried to make everything agentic. I've also seen projects succeed because they used agents where they made sense and simple solutions everywhere else. Be smart about it. Your users (and your wallet) will thank you.
